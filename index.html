        <p>Good day! I’m Jannelle Mae O. Magante, as a student who’s entering the field of Information Technology. I told myself to explore more in coding to gain more experience. Learning is my duties to expand knowledge in this field. My portfolio shows that doing things like coding and exploring may have a theoretical insight also in my journey as student. Then let’s go to have more in the future.</p>
